Subtly composed of a wide variety of striking flavours and scents, Moroccan cuisine draws its originality from a combination between Berber, Arab-Andalusian, and Jewish culinary traditions.

  <p style="text-align: center;">Subtly composed of a wide variety of striking flavours and scents, Moroccan cuisine draws its originality from a combination between Berber, Arab-Andalusian, and Jewish culinary traditions. Thanks to its rich cultural heritage specific to each region, Morocco has built an undisputed reputation worldwide. After a vote by 2.5 million Internet users, Moroccan cuisine was awarded the trophy for “World's Best Cuisine”.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Some of the emblematic dishes of the country that you can’t resist include:</p>
  <div class="foodlist"><ul>
    <li> Couscous</li>
    This authentic Moroccan couscous is a colorful dish made with perfectly cooked couscous topped with lamb, a variety of stewed veggies and a flavorful broth.
    <li>Tajine</li>
    The succulent, stew-like dish which is slow-cooked in the traditional cookware. Typically, a tagine is a rich mixture of meat, poultry, or fish, and most often includes vegetables or fruit. Vegetables may also be cooked alone in the tagine. 
    <li>Bastilla</li>
    A light, crispy warqa pastry shell conceals savory saffron chicken, spicy omelet stuffing, and a crunchy topping of fried almonds sweetened with orange flower water. A garnish of powdered sugar and cinnamon adds to the unique blend of flavors.
    <li>Mrouzia</li>
    A sweet and savory Moroccan tagine that’s seasoned with ras el hanout, ginger, saffron, and cinnamon. Honey not only adds sweetness, but in earlier times also acted as a preservative in tandem with the spices.
    <li>R'fissa</li>
    A wonderfully savory chicken, onion, and lentil dish that's served on a bed of shredded trid pastry, msemen, meloui, or even day-old bread.
